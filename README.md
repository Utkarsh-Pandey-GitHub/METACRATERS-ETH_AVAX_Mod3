## Contract Overview

The `Token` contract is a basic implementation of an ERC20-like token. It features the following components:

- `owner`: The address that deploys the contract and holds the initial supply of tokens.
- `_balances`: A mapping of addresses to their token balances.
- `_totalSupply`: The total supply of tokens in the contract.

## Usage

### Constructor

The contract constructor initializes the contract with an initial supply of tokens. The deploying address becomes the owner of the contract and holds the entire initial supply.

```solidity
constructor(uint256 initial_tokens)

```
### Modifiers
```onlyUser```: This modifier restricts the execution of certain functions to the contract owner.

```sufficientAmount(uint256 amount)```: This modifier checks whether the caller's balance is sufficient for the requested transaction.

### Functions
```mint(uint256 amount)```: Allows the owner to mint new tokens and add them to their balance.

```transfer(address to, uint256 amount)```: Allows users to transfer tokens to another address. The caller's balance is reduced, and the recipient's balance is increased.

```burn(uint256 amount)```: Allows users to burn (destroy) a specific amount of their tokens. The caller's balance and the total supply are reduced accordingly.

```balance(address user)```: Returns the token balance of a given address.

```totalSupply()```: Returns the total supply of tokens in the contract.
